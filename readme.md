#Welcome to MSTPit Project

##What's MSTPit?
MSTPit (tentatively) stands for Medical Scientist Training Program Information Transfer or alternatively Medical Scientist Training Pit (as in place for hang out).The primary aim of this project is to create a dynamic website for collecting and handling information pertaining to students in the MSTP. It is created initially in an attempt of making an easy to use website for collecting information needed in making abstract book for annual MSTP symposium, but we are hoping to expand it to become a website where information can be easiliy collected from current members of MSTP.
